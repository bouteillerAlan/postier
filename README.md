# Postier - A Modern HTTP Client

Postier is a cross-platform HTTP client built with Tauri, React, and TypeScript, designed to be a lightweight and fast alternative to Postman and equivalent. It provides a modern, intuitive interface for making HTTP requests and viewing responses.

I want it fully open-source, and privacy first.

## Features

- **HTTP Request Support**
  - Supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS and PATCH methods
  - URL input with method selection
  - Request body editor (formats: form-data, raw as text or javascript or JSON or HTML or XML, none)
  - Headers managements
  - Request history

- **Response Handling**
  - Real-time response display
  - Response in raw or preview or pretty
  - If the response is view in "pretty" you have syntax-highlighted in JSON, XML, HTML or Text
  - Response headers viewer
  - HTTP status code display
  - Error handling with clear error messages

- **User Interface**
  - Modern, clean design using Radix UI
  - Dark/Light mode support
  - Loading states with animated spinner
  - Tabbed interface for request/response data
